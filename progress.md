## MILESTONE LOG 📝

### 2025-08-14 - Strategic Pivot
**Completed**:
- ✅ Project plan review and validation
- ✅ Created structured `project-plan.md` with checkpoints
- ✅ Established `progress.md` for tracking
- ✅ Set up mandatory update protocol
- ✅ **PIVOT**: Revised approach to prioritize agent prompt and GitHub setup

**Key Decision**:
- **Change**: Moving from traditional phased approach to rapid prototype development
- **Rationale**: Following agent-11 successful pattern for faster validation
- **Impact**: Can deploy working agent within 2-3 days instead of weeks

**Insights**:
- Agent-11 structure provides proven template
- Prioritizing prompt development enables early testing
- GitHub repository with easy deployment is critical for adoption

**Next Actions**:
- Create MCP-7 agent prompt following agent-11 structure
- Use agent-optimizer for prompt enhancement
- Set up GitHub repository with installation scripts
- Create documentation for easy deployment

### 2025-08-14 - Phase 1 Milestones Completed
**Completed**:
- ✅ Created MCP-7 agent prompt with clear mission and boundaries
- ✅ Integrated comprehensive MCP service catalog from research
- ✅ Used agent-optimizer to enhance prompt (33% reduction, improved guardrails)
- ✅ Set up GitHub repository structure (.claude/agents/, deployment/, docs/)
- ✅ Created professional README with installation options
- ✅ Built installation script for one-line deployment

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Agent Prompt**: Production-ready with confidence scoring, error handling, escalation protocols
- **Knowledge Base**: 15+ MCP services cataloged with use cases and setup instructions
- **Repository**: Clean structure following agent-11 patterns
- **Installation**: Multiple options (curl, manual, git clone)

**Key Improvements from Optimizer**:
- Removed markdown formatting for consistency
- Added specific error messages and thresholds
- Implemented 60% confidence minimum
- Added "NEVER DO" guardrails
- Clear escalation to coordinator

**Next Actions**:
- Test agent with sample projects
- Validate MCP recommendations
- Create example use cases
- Push to GitHub repository
