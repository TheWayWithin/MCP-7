- User needed actual connection and configuration capabilities

**Resolution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `mcp-7-orchestrator.md` - Enhanced agent with full orchestration capabilities
- ✅ Added connection management and configuration generation
- ✅ Created `mcp-connection-guide.md` with comprehensive MCP service reference
- ✅ Built `mcp-orchestrate.sh` - Interactive installation script
- ✅ Built `validate-mcp.sh` - Configuration validation tool
- ✅ Updated installation script to deploy orchestrator version

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Can now analyze, recommend, install, configure, and validate MCPs
- **Connection Guide**: Complete reference for 10+ MCP services with exact commands
- **Automation Scripts**: Interactive tools for MCP installation and validation
- **Session Management**: Clear guidance for Claude Desktop restart requirements
- **Platform Support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

**Key Capabilities Added**:
1. Generate `claude_desktop_config.json` configurations
2. Execute npm installation commands
3. Validate service connections
4. Guide session restart with OS-specific instructions
5. Troubleshoot connection issues

**Impact**:
- MCP-7 now functions as a complete orchestration agent
- Can connect projects to MCP services, not just recommend them
- Provides exact commands and configuration files
- Guides users through entire setup process including restarts

**Version Upgrade**: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

### 2025-08-16 - Real-World Production Testing & Fixes ✅
**Issues Discovered During Live Testing**:
- Config file name changed: `claude_desktop_config.json` → `config.json`
- JSON structure changed: `mcpServers` → `mcp.servers`
- Many documented MCP packages don't exist on npm
- Package naming inconsistent between official and community

**Critical Fixes Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `mcp-packages-reality.md` with verified package list
- ✅ Built `mcp-orchestrate-v2.sh` with package validation
- ✅ Updated all scripts to detect config format automatically
- ✅ Added npm package existence validation before installation
- ✅ Fixed JSON structure handling for both old and new formats

**Production Improvements**:
- **Package Validation**: Checks npm registry before attempting install
- **Config Detection**: Auto-detects `config.json` vs `claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Format Handling**: Supports both `mcp.servers` and `mcpServers`
- **Error Recovery**: Provides alternatives when packages don't exist
- **User Guidance**: Clear messages about what's happening and why

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Always validate package existence before installation
2. Support multiple config formats for backward compatibility
3. Community packages use various naming conventions
4. Documentation often lags behind actual implementation
5. Real-world testing essential for production readiness
